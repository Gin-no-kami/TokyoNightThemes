### Manual installation:

1.  Download the [original metro for steam](https://github.com/minischetti/metro-for-steam/releases/tag/v4.4), extract to `~/.steam/steam/skins/[name]` (linux) or `c:\Program Files\Steam\skins (windows)`. If the skins folder doesn't exist, create it.
2.  Download the [latest release of the metro patch](https://github.com/redsigma/UPMetroSkin/tags)
3.  Extract the contents of [Unofficial 4.x patch/Main Files](https://github.com/redsigma/UPMetroSkin/tree/master/Unofficial%204.x%20Patch/Main%20Files%20[Install%20First]) into the folder you put the original metro. Make sure to replace/overwrite, rather than skipping!
4.  Copy all contents of theme's folder into the folder with metro
5.  In steam, go to settings->interface, then change skin to the name of your metro folder. If you did this right, steam should prompt you to restart-- press OK, and steam should restart.
6.  Enjoy your new theme!
